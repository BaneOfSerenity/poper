Poper is partly inspired by an [article](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) written by [tpope](https://twitter.com/tpope). That's where the name comes from actually. It was created to be primarily used by [Pronto](https://github.com/mmozuras/pronto), but could be used anywhere else as well.
